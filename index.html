<h1>Project Proposal</h1>

    <p>
    For my final project, I'm exploring two potential directions for an interactive visual 
    experience. The first concept is inspired by the 1982 animated film The Last Unicorn, 
    which has always captivated me with its dreamlike animation, melancholic storytelling, 
    and themes of loss and transformation. Alternatively, I'm considering creating something 
    much more playful and bright, inspired by the joy and wonder of childhood picture booksâ€”
    think vibrant colors, whimsical illustrations, and interactive elements that invite 
    exploration and delight. Both directions excite me for different reasons: one captures 
    a darker, more ethereal beauty while the other celebrates innocence and imagination. 
    Through this project, I want to experiment with how visual design, color theory, typography, 
    and interactivity can evoke completely different emotional experiences, whether that's 
    the bittersweet magic of The Last Unicorn or the pure joy of a children's storybook 
    brought to life on screen.
